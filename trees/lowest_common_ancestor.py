Hints
Given a binary search tree (BST) where all node values are unique, and two nodes from the tree p and q, return the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of the two nodes.

The lowest common ancestor between two nodes p and q is the lowest node in a tree T such that both p and q as descendants. The ancestor is allowed to be a descendant of itself.

Example 1:



Input: root = [5,3,8,1,4,7,9,null,2], p = 3, q = 8

Output: 5

class TreeNode:
    def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
        self.val = val
        self.left = left
        self.right = right
        


class Solution:
    def lowestCommonAncestor(self, root: TreeNode, p: TreeNode, q: TreeNode) -> TreeNode:
        if not root:
            return None

        # If both p and q are smaller, LCA must be in left subtree    
        if p.val < root.val and q.val < root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.left, p, q)

        # If both p and q are larger, LCA must be in right subtree
        elif p.val > root.val and q.val > root.val:
            return self.lowestCommonAncestor(root.right, p, q)

        # Otherwise, root is between p and q, so root is the LCA
        return root
